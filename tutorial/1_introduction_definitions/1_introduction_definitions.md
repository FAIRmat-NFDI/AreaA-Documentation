# Content and structure of part 1: Introduction and Definitions

This part is based on our Area A FAIRmat user meeting talk.

## Structure:
1. Motivation: RDM in synthesis (or more general?)
   * present situation 
   * towards data-driven methods and automatization
   * why good RDM?
2. FAIRmat and Area A, NOMAD
   * RDM by FAIRmat and Area A: short overview on FAIRmat and our area
   * NOMAD as our tool we develop for FAIR RDM, only short since we go in detail later:
     * central NOMAD (and where it comes from), NOMAD Oasis --> local RDM tool, NOMAD ELN functionality --> directly produce FAIR and structured data (in contrast to other ELN approaches/philosophies), concept of data workflow in NOMAD (diagram), structure first approach
   * in this tutorial: how to get to FAIR and structured data --> schema
3. Structured data, FAIR data, schema etc
   * data workflow: raw data, ELN, data analysis --> data model (schema) --> implementation in NOMAD
   * schema, template concepts
   * FAIRmat approach
   * 

## Definitions:
* FAIRmat
* FAIRmat Area A

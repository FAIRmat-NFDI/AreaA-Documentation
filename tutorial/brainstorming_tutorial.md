      - ...  
    - ...  
  - write schema file  
    - how complex can we go here? Audience is rather data stewards or people with data skills  
  - ...  
- **Hands on tutorial:**  
  - replay what was shown in tutorial before:  
    - create an upload by schema and example file and fill in data test different functionalities

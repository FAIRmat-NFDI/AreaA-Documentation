# FAIRmat tutorials planning  
- **speakers**: Area A internal?!  
- **Date:** Mar 15th, 2023 afternoon?!  
- **concept:**  
  - live tutorial!  
  - tutorial should be useful for Area A training activities --> new NOMAD users, data stewards,  
  - have the resulting youtube video in mind, which should be atractive to watch later on!  
  - ...  
  - show example which follows base class idea
  - 
- **target audience:** NOMAD users (scientists) and data stewards?  --> both: parts for both audiences
- **goals**
  - have a good own documentation so we can point new user to it before meeting with us.So we save time and repeat ourselves less
  - Explain concept of an ELN that is based on structured data in contrast to the standard ELN s
- **content:**   
  what content could we provide?  
  - stress Oasis in NOMAD Oasis  
  - data revision  
  - data modeling  
  - data schema writing based on custom schema  
  - using schema in ELN  
    - functionalities:  
      - base classes  
      - general workflow outline: tasks, inputs&outputs, etc  
      - sample ID  
      - user  
      - csv+xlsx parser, maybe also other parsers? probably  
      - flexibility of tasks: + button to add new taks flexibly  
      - referencing to data files (+ in other uploads) e.g. inventory of substrates  
      - referencing to other schema files --> tasks  
      - automatic plots  
      - ...  
    - inventory  
    - organizing schemas  
    - ...  
  - ...  
- **parts or sections of tutorial**   
  idealy we break down the content in sections of ~10min, better for youtube videos later  
  - no additional speaker about FAIR blabla
  - introduction about this tutorial: overview, targeted audience, goals, data stewardship outline 
  - definitions: what is a schema, a template? how do schema and data file work together? (methods, concept of structured data etc.) yaml file, text/code editor (notepad++, ghost writer, vscode)
  - data revision:
  
  - user targeted video: actions needed to upload and publish data 
    - create upload and add files (schema, data, raw files), idea/strucuture of upload folder, manage access etc. add readme.md, publish  
    - instantiate an entry  
      - by data file  
      - by entering name and choose schema  
    - navigate into entry:  
      - explain sections: overview, files, data, log  
      - entry references  
    - fill out entry manually and by dropping a file which gets parsed an populates quantities  
    - normalization functionality
    - search your data (not results section)
  
  - write schema file 
    - what is yaml file, intendations
    - add one section with one quantity
    - upload and test it --> 
    - which quanities do we have? 
  - more advanced usage of NOMAD:

    - xlsx parser (15min)
    - plotting  (15min)
    - referencing to other files and (not schemas!) (depends on Area D)
    - base classes:
        - sample ID 
        - user
        - reference doi
        - substance
        -
  - editable template
        - 
  - explore data: 
      -  custom search
      -  dashboard
      -  explain results section --> link to base classes
      -  activity

    - ...  
  - write schema file  
    - how complex can we go here? Audience is rather data stewards or people with data skills

- **Hands on tutorial:**  
  - replay what was shown in tutorial before:  
    - create an upload by schema and example file and fill in data test different functionalities  
  - write or extend an existing schema  
  - ...  
  -  
  -   - - demo of a simple schema and or demo of our general workflow schema: 
  -       - demo of:  
      - sample ID  
      - referencing to data files or instantiate data files if not existing  
      - ...  
      - 
  -

# General Information on the tutorial

**title:** 
* Electronic lab notebook (ELN) functionality in NOMAD
* Electronic lab notebook (ELN) functionality in NOMAD for FAIR data

**date:** 15.03.2023, 14:00 to 17:00 (break at ~15:30)

**goal of tutorial:** 
* basic usage of NOMAD (upload data and search it), 
* getting started for NOMAD, 
* advanced usage of NOMAD --> make use of base classes and parsers
* write simple schema, modify/extend complex schemas 
* show concept of our data model + base classes
  
**schedule:**
| Section | Speaker | time | comment/content |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1. introduction + definitions | Andrea & Sebastian |
| 1b  structured data/information (user, global etc, inheritance) --> the key points | Andrea & Sebastian |
| 2. NOMAD usage, UX (not the structure)  | Florian |  |  |
| 3. data revision + write schema | Hampus |  | |
| 4. more advanced usage: xlsx + plotting | Andrea | - | - |
| 5. more advanced usage: base classes functionality + referencing | Hampus | | |
| 6. explore data | Pepe | | |

**abstract:** structured data, ELN, NOMAD, schema, for scientist (usage), for data stewards (write schemas)  ...
**logo/picture:** ideas? Area F? 

**concept:** 
* pingpong of lecture and hands-on part, 
* from simple to more complex content, 
* audience interested scientists to data stewards
* have resulting YouTube videos in mind as learning resource
* Q: we could produce videos before and replay and then interact on content in tutorial? --> post production based on feedback

**deadlines:**
* [ ] communicate general information to Lucia 15.02.2023 --> Sebastian
* [ ] announce tutorial in FAIRmat channels on 17.02.2023 --> Lucia
* [ ] announce tutorial in your network on 17.02.2023


**NOMAD:**
* use official public beta!?
* use current state of NOMAD develop --> will this go into public beta?
* Jupyter Hub should be available!?
* any critical issues or MR to be closed until tutorial?

**Questions:**
* examples of tutorial in *documentation* repo? 
* provide as *example in NOMAD* like Area B stuff? 
* examples for tutorial: try to keep a *red line* throughout the tutorial
* examples/uploads are connected
* define example and then split up and then implement example upload in NOMAD as MR
* there is a strucuture and a data model this is what people see in the ELN demo, (but is under developement and is taking input from different communities)
## use case
* MBE SiGe --> process data!!!
  * Andrea will place example in tutorial folder 
* base classes:
  * sample ID --> result of community discussion
  * substance 
  * publication ref.
  * activity? (method)
* Andea: Amir needs to implement xlsx-parser things!

* Electronic lab notebook (ELN) functionality in NOMAD
* Electronic lab notebook (ELN) functionality in NOMAD for FAIR data

**date:** 15.03.2023, 14:00 to 17:00 (break at ~15:30)

**goal of tutorial:** 
* basic usage of NOMAD (upload data and search it), 
* getting started for NOMAD, 
* advanced usage of NOMAD --> make use of base classes and parsers
* write simple schema, modify/extend complex schemas 
* show concept of our data model + base classes
  
**schedule:**
| Section | Speaker | time | comment/content |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1. introduction + definitions | Andrea |
| 2. NOMAD usage  | Florian |  |  |
| 3. data revision + write schema | Hampus |  | |
| 4. more advanced usage: xlsx + plotting | Andrea | - | - |
| 5. more advanced usage: base classes + referencing | Hampus | | |
| 6. explore data | Pepe | | |

**abstract:** structured data, ELN, NOMAD, schema, for scientist (usage), for data stewards (write schemas)  ...
**logo/picture:** ideas? Area F? 

**concept:** 
* pingpong of lecture and hands-on part, 
* from simple to more complex content, 
* audience interested scientists to data stewards
* have resulting YouTube videos in mind as learning resource
* Q: we could produce videos before and replay and then interact on content in tutorial?

**deadlines:**
* [ ] communicate general information to Lucia 15.02.2023 --> Sebastian
* [ ] announce tutorial in FAIRmat channels on 17.02.2023 --> Lucia
* [ ] announce tutorial in your network on 17.02.2023


**NOMAD:**
* use official public beta!?
* use current state of NOMAD develop --> will this go into public beta?
* Jupyter Hub should be available!?
* any critical issues or MR to be closed until tutorial?
*
